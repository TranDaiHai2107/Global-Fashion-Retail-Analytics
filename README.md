# 🌍 Global Fashion Retail Analytics – Forecasting & BI System

## 📌 Project Overview

This project leverages the **Global Fashion Retail Analytics Dataset** to build an end-to-end analytics and forecasting system.

The objective is to:

- Forecast sales performance using advanced time series and machine learning models  
- Segment customers using clustering techniques  
- Design a scalable BI pipeline using SQL Server (SSIS & SSAS)  
- Enable multi-country, multi-currency retail analysis  

This project simulates a real-world multinational retail analytics environment.

## 🗂 Dataset Description

The dataset used in this project is the **Global Fashion Retail Stores Dataset** from Kaggle:  
🔗 https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ricgomes/global-fashion-retail-stores-dataset

It includes:

- 4M+ transaction records  
- 35 stores across 7 countries:
  - United States
  - China
  - Germany
  - United Kingdom
  - France
  - Spain
  - Portugal
- Multi-currency transactions: USD, EUR, CNY, GBP  
- Customer demographics (age, occupation)  
- Product categories (Feminine, Masculine, Children)  
- Pricing & discount data  
- Employee/store performance information  

This dataset introduces controlled complexity such as missing job titles and inconsistent formats to simulate real-world retail data challenges.
